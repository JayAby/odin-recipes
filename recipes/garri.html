         <h2>Garri</h2>

         <p>Garri, pronounced gah-ree, is made from granulated cassava, a root vegetable that’s poisonous unless you peel and cook it first. 
            Commonly found in West Africa, there are two types of garri: yellow and white. 
            The flavor depends on how long it’s been fermented and the presence of palm oil.

          <h2>Steps and Preparation</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Firstly</strong>, Add your garri to a bowl or cup <em>(bowl is much enjoyable tho, my opinion)</em> feel free to rinse with tap water <em>(not a neccesity)</em></li>
            <li><strong>Secondly</strong>, Add your sweetner to the raw garri and stir, make sure you stir properly, so the sweetner gets to every part of the meal
            <em>Please note, the sweetner can be either sugar or honey.</em> Also it's not compulsory to use a sweetner.</li>
            <li>After adding your swwetner, add some ice block, garri is best enjoyed when it is cool.</li>
            <li>Optional, but you can use supplements, like kuli-kuli ,dried fish, akara, groudnut and many others to enjoy your garri, I personally prefer groudnut and roasted meat</li>
          </ol>
